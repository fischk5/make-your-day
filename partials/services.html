      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>I am here for the person who wants full responsibility for planning their own wedding, but could still use a
        helping hand on the wedding day and possibly the rehearsal, to ensure that your vision becomes a reality.</p>
      <p>Although a Day Of Coordinator is typically booked well in advance of the wedding, I do not get involved until
        1-2 weeks prior to wedding day. On the day of the wedding, I will be present at the venue/s to ensure every
        detail is set up the way you have envisioned, the timeline of the day is adhered to as much as possible and
        clean-up is handled per your direction.</p>
      <p>As your Day Of Coordinator, I will be the liaison between you and the vendors for the day.
        This will hopefully relieve you of unnecessary stress, which is, in a nutshell, what being a Day Of Coordinator is really all about.
        During the ceremony and reception the Day Of Coordinator's responsibility is to ensure everything runs smoothly.</p>
      <p>The goal is to adhere to the timeline, but in the event that this isnâ€™t possible (and that will happen
        more often than you think!), it is the Day Of Coordinator's responsibility to ensure that events are rearranged
        in such a way that incurs minimal cost and stress to the bride, groom, their families and their guests.</p>
      <h4>Responsibilities</h4>
      <p>My responsibilities typically include, but are not exclusive or limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assisting you in organizing and executing your plans for the rehearsal, ceremony, and reception</li>
        <li>Coordinating with all vendors to ensure their instructions and plan go according to your vision</li>
        <li>Reviewing all contractual obligations of each vendor with you, as needed</li>
        <li>Setting up reception site amenities and ensuring vendors are assisted properly per your plan</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Keep in mind that this is a basic overview, not a complete list of services.
        When we meet, your specific needs will be discussed in detail!</p>
